# Changes
## HTML
I've added the ANS button which can be found on the bottom of the calculator.
## CSS
Added flex values for the ANS button and made the text warp so the calculator doesnt strectch out, nor the text goes where it pleases.
## Javascript
Completed the basic assignment plus all of the advanced criteria ones. I helped myself with AI even though I'm not proud of that fact, but my workflow with Javascript is as fast as a snail because its still something new to me + I haven't been paying much attention. I multiple times to just perfect the basic code AI gave me but after realising that I would be handing over the assignment in July, I used my extensive (irony) knowledge of english to communicate stuff out either with AI or StackOverflow which was the 2nd largest help in this project. 
## Lanching the calculator
By having previous expirience from the previous assignment, I was able to launch the calculator as a website on Netlify, the website can be found [here](https://courageous-lokum-fe5d2f.netlify.app).
## Conclusion
This file only exists because I was lazy and didnt do the commit messages properly and in case of my absence it You would be able to check on it yourself and not get lost.
