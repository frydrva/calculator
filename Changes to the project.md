# Changes
## HTML
I've added the ANS button which can be found on the bottom of the calculator.
## CSS
Added flex values for the ANS button and made the text warp so the calculator doesnt strectch out, nor the text goes where it pleases.
## Lanching the calculator
By having previous expirience from the previous assignment, I was able to launch the calculator as a website on Netlify, the website can be found [here][https://courageous-lokum-fe5d2f.netlify.app]
